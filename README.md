## INTRO 
  * In this day and age 99% of people are scared when they hear about cryptocurrencies.Whenever someone mentions Bitcoin they are normally shaken to the core. Nobody blames them due to the backlash it has received due to the numerous scams of pump and dump whereby making people loose a lot of money hence it  also spoils it's rep even more.In order to extract this negative thoughts and introduce cryptocurrencies properly, I decided to create this app where people will see the gems in cryptocurrencies.

## Project Guidlines

### Home Screen
* This page contains the basic fundamentals of what you need   to  know abou crypto sources were different blogs and books which I summarised to be as short and understable .

### CRPTO LIST
* When you click on crypto at the top it will load a list of different crypto currencies from the most known to the least known.
* It includes the symbol, name and market value
* Those are the basic fundamentals you need to know as a beginner so that was the only thing I included in the crypto list.
