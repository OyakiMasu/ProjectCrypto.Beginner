## INTRO 
  * In this day and age 99% of people are scared when they hear about cryptocurrencies.Whenever someone mentions Bitcoin they are normally shaken to the core. Nobody blames them due to the backlash it has received due to the numerous scams of pump and dump whereby making people loose a lot of money hence it  also spoils it's rep even more.In order to extract this negative thoughts and introduce cryptocurrencies properly, I decided to create this app where people will see the gems in cryptocurrencies.

## Project Guidlines
