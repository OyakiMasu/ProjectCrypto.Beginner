    <h2 class="blockchain head 2" id="block-head2">What is Blockchain for beginners?</h2>

    <p class="blockcahin desc" id="block-desc"> On the surface Blockchain technology seems impossible to understand, with
        any definition typically accompanied by a load of jargon. However, if we take a
        step back and look at Blockchain technology in simple terms, it becomes far
        easier to grasp.
    
        The Blockchain is a database that gets distributed to every computer on the
        network, instead of connecting to a central server. This is advantageous be-
        cause it makes the Blockchain near-impossible to take down. The database
        contains the data from every transaction that takes place on a network, every
        time a new transaction occurs it gets added to the database.
        These lists of transactions are separated into manageable “blocks”, which
        each contain a transaction timestamp and a link to the previous block. Be
        cause each block has to be validated by every computer on the network, it
        makes it impossible to falsify a transaction, resulting in a tamper-proof ledger
        containing every transaction to ever take place.

    <h4 class="blockchain head 4" id="block-head4">1. Volatility</h4>
    <p class="blockchain vol">(Def) Volatility - Volatility is a measure of how much the price of an asset has moved up or down over time. 
        Generally, the more volatile an asset is, the riskier its considered to be as an investment 
        — and the more potential it has to offer either higher returns or higher losses over shorter periods of 
        time than comparatively less volatile assets.

        -I won't get much into this cause it involves some technicallity and this is for beginners so I will let you have some fun with other databases on this!

    <h5 class="blockchain head 5" id="block-head5">2. Emotions</h5>
    <p class="blockchain emo" id="block-emo">
        In cryptocurrency, managing your emotions well can be the difference be-
        tween making thousands and losing everything. Every trader goes through a
        cycle of emotions, when everything is green and the market is in your favour
        you’ll become elated and euphoric, when it begins to drop anxiety and fear start
        to take hold, culminating and intensifying as the price continues to fall until you
        reach the and find anger and despair.
        
        Where along this cycle would you sell? You might be thinking “just as anx-
        iety and fear take hold”, after all, this would shield you from any large losses. In
        reality, that’s already far too late, it’s better to sell at peak happiness, right when
        your investments are hitting all-time highs.
        
        A period of extreme growth is almost always followed by a dip, which
        would allow you to buy back in, increasing your position size. Once you master
        your emotions you can trade without bias, putting you on the path to becoming
        a professional trader.</p>
